The project is a DX-Ball clone, a classic brick-breaking game, implemented in Assembly language.
The game features a simple yet engaging gameplay mechanic where a player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen to bounce a ball upwards, aiming to hit 
and eliminate bricks located at the top. Each brick hit by the ball is "deleted" or made inactive, contributing to the player's score.
The primary objective is to clear all bricks from the screen without letting the ball pass through the bottom edge, which would lead to a game over scenario.

to add: the deletion is not working proparly
